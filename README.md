     4.  File Format â€“ .pbix for development and .png for dashboard previews.

4. Business problem solved:-
   Banks manage vast amounts of customer and transaction data daily, yet transforming this data into actionable insights remains a challenge. Without clear visibility into      key performance indicators across deposits, loans, and customer behavior, bank decision-makers may struggle to identify growth opportunities, detect risks, or optimize       operations.
     1. This dashboard aims to solve the problem of data fragmentation and lack of real-time visibility by providing a centralized, interactive, and visual analysis of core          banking metrics. Specifically, it addresses the need to:
     2. Understand overall bank performance at a glance (Overview page)
     3. Analyze deposit trends and identify top-performing regions or customer segments (Deposit Analysis page)
     4. Monitor loan issuance patterns, identify risk exposures, and evaluate portfolio health (Loan Analysis page)
     5. By presenting these insights clearly and interactively, the dashboard supports better strategic decision-making, risk management, and customer targeting, ultimately          helping the bank improve profitability and operational efficiency.
