1. Banking Loan/Deposit Analysis
    1. A dynamic, interactive data visualization dashboard built to generate insights by comparing bank loans and bank deposits.
       This  project involves a comprehensive analysis of a banking dataset to extract meaningful insights and support data-driven decision-making. Using Python and the              pandas library, I performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the structure, distribution, and relationships within the data. The analysis includes:
           1. Univariate analysis to examine individual variables such as deposit amounts, loan balances, customer age, and account types.
           2. Bivariate analysis to explore interactions between features like loan approval vs. income, or deposit trends across customer segments.
   
3. Description of dashboard

       1. Provide a high-level summary of key bank metrics.
       2. Suggested Visuals & KPIs:

       5. Net profit (if applicable)
       6. Number of branches/accounts

   2. Deposit Analysis Page
      1. Purpose: Deep dive into deposit-related metrics.
      2. Total deposits by: Region, Customer type, Account type
      3. Average balance trends over time
      4. New deposit accounts per month

   3. Loan Analysis Page
      1. Purpose: Analyze loan performance and risk.
      2. Visuals: Total loans issued ,Loan disbursement trends
      3. Loan type distribution (e.g., home, auto, personal,commercial)
      4. Delinquency

4. Tech Stack
 The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:
     1. ðŸ“Š Power BI Desktop â€“ Main data visualization platform used for report creation.
     2. ðŸ“‚ Power Query â€“ Data transformation and cleaning layer for reshaping and preparing the data.
     3. ðŸ§  DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) â€“ Used for calculated measures, dynamic visuals, and conditional logic.
     4.  File Format â€“ .pbix for development and .png for dashboard previews.

5. Business problem solved:-
   Banks manage vast amounts of customer and transaction data daily, yet transforming this data into actionable insights remains a challenge. Without clear visibility into      key performance indicators across deposits, loans, and customer behavior, bank decision-makers may struggle to identify growth opportunities, detect risks, or optimize       operations.
     1. This dashboard aims to solve the problem of data fragmentation and lack of real-time visibility by providing a centralized, interactive, and visual analysis of core          banking metrics. Specifically, it addresses the need to:
     2. Understand overall bank performance at a glance (Overview page)
     3. Analyze deposit trends and identify top-performing regions or customer segments (Deposit Analysis page)
     4. Monitor loan issuance patterns, identify risk exposures, and evaluate portfolio health (Loan Analysis page)
     5. By presenting these insights clearly and interactively, the dashboard supports better strategic decision-making, risk management, and customer targeting, ultimately          helping the bank improve profitability and operational efficiency.
