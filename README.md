4. Business problem solved:-
   Banks manage vast amounts of customer and transaction data daily, yet transforming this data into actionable insights remains a challenge. Without clear visibility into      key performance indicators across deposits, loans, and customer behavior, bank decision-makers may struggle to identify growth opportunities, detect risks, or optimize       operations.
   -This dashboard aims to solve the problem of data fragmentation and lack of real-time visibility by providing a centralized, interactive, and visual analysis of core          banking metrics. Specifically, it addresses the need to:
   -Understand overall bank performance at a glance (Overview page)
   -Analyze deposit trends and identify top-performing regions or customer segments (Deposit Analysis page)
   -Monitor loan issuance patterns, identify risk exposures, and evaluate portfolio health (Loan Analysis page)
-By presenting these insights clearly and interactively, the dashboard supports better strategic decision-making, risk management, and customer targeting, ultimately helping the bank improve profitability and operational efficiency.
